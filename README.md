# HW2-Portfolio

#HW2-Portfolio
For this project, I created my first portfolio web page - titled "#HW2-Portfolio".

#Purpose
This page gave me practice on using HTML and CSS to design a webpage and gives me a base to track my work as a learning developer (a developing developer you could say). This page provides some information about me, provides access to my current (and future) list of projects, and my contact information.

#Usage
To view my page, simply click the attached link and you'll be able to see the deployed project.

https://fvjr.github.io/HW2-Portfolio/

 #Contributing 
 To access the code, acess my GitHub repo titled "HW2-Portfolio". My GitHub is linked on the page. If you have any ideas of how to simplify or improve some code, please feel free to reach out! I'll be working on the page as I have time to improve it.
